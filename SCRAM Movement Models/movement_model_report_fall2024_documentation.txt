This documentation is intended to accompany the following scripts run for SCRAM v2.1.4:
1. movement_model_report_addendum_feb2024_rekn.R renamed to movement_model_SCRAM2_1state_rekn.R
2. movement_model_report_addendum_feb2024_pipl.R renamed to movement_model_SCRAM2_1state_pipl.R
3. movement_model_report_addendum_feb2024_rost.R renamed to movement_model_SCRAM2_1state_rost.R

The SCRAM v2.1.4 Tool is described in the accompanying 2024 BOEM Report (Goyert et al. 2024).
The SCRAM v1.0.3 Tool is described in the accompanying 2022 BOEM report (Adams et al. 2022).

The scripts source the following shared functions (~/SCRAM Movement Models/):
1. serial_time.R
2. Pr_occupancy_season_trunc.R

	The scripts no longer source the following shared functions (~/SCRAM Movement Models/):
	1. remove_dup_bursts.R

	The Piping Plover (_pipl.R) and Roseate Tern (_rost.R) scripts no longer source the following shared functions (~/SCRAM Movement Models/):
	1. false_pos_filter.R
	2. remove_false_pos.R

The scripts source the following shared GIS data (~/data/):
1. BOEM_halfdeg_grid_latlon_2021.shp contains georeferenced grid of 512 polygons on the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf (other metadata no longer relevant)

The Red Knot (_rekn.R) script additionally sources the following data from Loring et al. 2021(~/data/):
1. Appendix_C_Motus_Detection_Data_REKN.rds

The Piping Plover (_pipl.R) script additionally sources the following data from Loring et al. 2019 (~/data/):
